# shadcn/ui Integration Complete! ðŸŽ‰

## What's Been Set Up

âœ… **Manual Configuration Complete**
- Created `components.json` with proper paths
- Added CSS variables for theming
- Configured Tailwind extensions
- Added all Radix UI dependencies
- Created example Button component
- Updated PopupOptimized to use shadcn/ui Button

âœ… **Developer Experience**
- Helper script: `./add-component.sh` in packages/ui
- Full TypeScript support
- Hot module reloading works
- Light/dark theme support

## Quick Start

### Adding Components
```bash
cd packages/ui

# Method 1: Use the helper script
./add-component.sh card dialog input

# Method 2: Direct CLI
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add card
```

### Using Components
```tsx
// In any page/component
import { Button, Card, Dialog } from "@extension/ui";

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Button variant="destructive" size="sm">
      Click me
    </Button>
  );
}
```

## Architecture Decisions

1. **Shared UI Package**: All shadcn/ui components live in `packages/ui` for reusability across the extension

2. **Global Tailwind Config**: Theme colors and utilities are defined in `packages/tailwindcss-config` to ensure consistency

3. **CSS Variables**: Using CSS custom properties for theming allows dynamic theme switching

4. **Minimal Bundle Size**: Only import components you actually use

## Known Considerations

1. **Chrome Extension CSP**: Most shadcn/ui components work fine, but some with inline styles may need adjustments

2. **Build Process**: Always run `pnpm ready` in packages/ui after adding new components

3. **Dark Mode**: Add `dark` class to root element for dark theme

## Next Steps

1. Add more components as needed:
   ```bash
   cd packages/ui
   ./add-component.sh input card dialog sheet
   ```

2. Create custom theme by modifying CSS variables in `packages/ui/lib/global.css`

3. Consider creating wrapper components for commonly used patterns

## Troubleshooting

If you see Tailwind errors about missing classes:
1. Ensure `packages/ui` is built: `cd packages/ui && pnpm ready`
2. Check that global.css is imported in your page
3. Verify the build process includes the UI package CSS

The integration is now complete and ready for use! ðŸš€
